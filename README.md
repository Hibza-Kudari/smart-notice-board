## ⚙️ Operation Overview

### 🔌 Component Connections:
- Arduino UNO  
- Bluetooth Module HC-05  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Power Supply  

### 🚀 System Workflow:
1. **Setup**: Initialize Arduino, LCD, and pair with a Bluetooth device.
2. **Data Transmission**: Send text data from a Bluetooth-connected phone or PC.
3. **Processing**: Arduino reads the data via SoftwareSerial.
4. **Display**: Text appears on the LCD; scrolling logic handles display updates.
